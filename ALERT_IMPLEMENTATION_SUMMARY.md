# Comprehensive Alert System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive monitoring and alert system for the Solana Validator Switch CLI that tracks SSH failures, RPC failures, and validator delinquency with proper state management to prevent false alarms.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. RPC Failure False Alarms
**Problem**: When RPC calls failed (due to throttling or network issues), the system was losing track of the last vote slot timestamp, causing false delinquency alerts.

**Solution**: Modified the vote data refresh logic to preserve existing slot times when RPC fails:
```rust
// Before: new_slot_times.push(None); // Lost timestamp!
// After: new_slot_times.push(state.last_vote_slot_times.get(idx).and_then(|&v| v));
```

### 2. SSH Failure Monitoring
**Problem**: No tracking of SSH connection failures, making it hard to distinguish between server downtime and validator issues.

**Solution**: Implemented `FailureTracker` for SSH connections with:
- Consecutive failure counting
- Time-based threshold (60 seconds default)
- Count-based threshold (5 failures default)
- Separate alerts for SSH failures

### 3. RPC Failure Monitoring
**Problem**: No tracking of RPC failures, making it hard to identify API throttling or endpoint issues.

**Solution**: Implemented RPC failure tracking with:
- Consecutive failure counting
- Time-based threshold (30 seconds default)
- Count-based threshold (10 failures default)
- Separate alerts for RPC failures

### 4. Enhanced Delinquency Alerts
**Problem**: Delinquency alerts didn't include context about SSH/RPC health.

**Solution**: Created `send_delinquency_alert_with_health` that includes:
- SSH connection status
- RPC connection status
- Makes it clear if the issue is connectivity vs actual delinquency

## New Components

### 1. Types (`src/types.rs`)
- `FailureTracker`: Tracks consecutive failures, timing, and errors
- `NodeHealthStatus`: Comprehensive health tracking per validator
- New alert configuration fields for thresholds

### 2. Alert Manager (`src/alert.rs`)
- `send_ssh_failure_alert`: Alerts for SSH connection issues
- `send_rpc_failure_alert`: Alerts for RPC connection issues
- `send_delinquency_alert_with_health`: Enhanced delinquency alerts
- `ComprehensiveAlertTracker`: Manages cooldowns for different alert types

### 3. Status UI Updates (`src/commands/status_ui_v2.rs`)
- Integrated failure tracking into vote data refresh
- Integrated SSH health monitoring with alerts
- Proper state preservation on failures

### 4. Configuration (`config.example.yaml`)
```yaml
alert_config:
  enabled: true
  delinquency_threshold_seconds: 30
  ssh_failure_threshold_seconds: 60
  rpc_failure_threshold_seconds: 30
  ssh_failure_count_threshold: 5
  rpc_failure_count_threshold: 10
```

## Alert Types

### 1. SSH Connection Failure
- Triggers when SSH fails for 60 seconds OR 5 consecutive failures
- Includes validator identity, node label, failure count, duration, and error

### 2. RPC Connection Failure  
- Triggers when RPC fails for 30 seconds OR 10 consecutive failures
- Includes validator identity, vote pubkey, failure count, duration, and error

### 3. Enhanced Delinquency Alert
- Triggers when validator stops voting for threshold duration
- Now includes SSH and RPC health status
- Users can see if it's a connectivity issue or actual delinquency

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite (`src/alert_tests.rs`) covering:
- Failure tracker state management
- Alert cooldown logic
- Threshold triggering
- RPC failure slot time preservation
- Combined failure scenarios
- Multiple validator tracking

## Benefits
1. **Reduced False Alarms**: RPC failures no longer trigger false delinquency alerts
2. **Better Diagnostics**: Users know if issues are SSH, RPC, or actual validator problems
3. **Configurable Thresholds**: Users can adjust sensitivity based on their needs
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into all aspects of validator health
5. **Proper State Management**: Failures are tracked accurately with time and count

## Usage
Users will automatically benefit from these improvements. They can:
1. Adjust thresholds in their config file if needed
2. Receive more informative alerts about the actual problem
3. Take appropriate action based on the specific failure type
