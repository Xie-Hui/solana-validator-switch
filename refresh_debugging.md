# Refresh Functionality Debugging

## Current Implementation

### When 'r' is pressed:
1. Check if we're in Status view
2. Set `is_refreshing = true` and all field refresh states immediately
3. Spawn async task to run `refresh_all_fields`
4. The spawned task runs refresh for each validator/node

### UI should show:
- Footer: "r: Refresh | ðŸ”„ Refreshing..." 
- Status field: "ðŸ”„ Checking... (node-label)"
- Identity field: "ðŸ”„ Refreshing..."
- Client/Version field: "ðŸ”„ Detecting..."

### Test Key Added:
- Press 't' to toggle refresh states manually
- This helps verify if UI updates are working

## Debugging Steps

1. **Test with 't' key first**
   - Press 't' to toggle refresh indicators
   - If indicators show, UI updates are working
   - If not, there's an issue with state propagation

2. **Test with 'r' key**
   - Press 'r' to trigger actual refresh
   - Watch for loading indicators
   - Check if UI freezes

## Possible Issues

1. **UI not updating**: Event loop might be blocked
2. **State not propagating**: RwLock contention
3. **SSH commands blocking**: Even in spawned tasks, SSH might block the runtime

## Next Steps

If 't' works but 'r' doesn't:
- The issue is likely in the SSH command execution
- Consider using tokio::task::spawn_blocking for SSH operations

If 't' doesn't work:
- The UI state updates aren't being reflected
- Check the draw functions and state reading
