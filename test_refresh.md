# Testing Refresh Functionality

## What was implemented:

1. **Field-by-field refresh** - The 'r' key now triggers async refresh of individual fields
2. **Loading indicators** - While refreshing, fields show "ðŸ”„ Refreshing..." 
3. **Async updates** - Each field updates independently without blocking the UI

## Fields that refresh:

1. **Status** (Active/Standby) - Uses catchup command to determine if node is active
2. **Identity** - Extracts current identity from catchup command output  
3. **Version** - Extracts version info based on validator type
4. **Sync Status** - Shows sync status from catchup command

## How to test:

1. Run `./target/debug/svs status`
2. Press 'r' to trigger refresh
3. Watch for loading indicators in the table
4. Fields should update with fresh data

## What happens during refresh:

- The catchup command is run on each node to get identity and sync status
- Status is determined by comparing identity with funded validator identity
- Version is extracted using the appropriate command for each validator type
- All updates happen asynchronously without blocking the UI

## Expected behavior:

- Footer shows "ðŸ”„ Refreshing..." when refresh is active
- Individual fields show "ðŸ”„ Refreshing..." while being updated
- Fields update one by one as data comes in
- UI remains responsive during refresh
