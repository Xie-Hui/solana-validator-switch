## Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Switching**: Get the fastest switch possible with optimized operations
- **Runtime Status Detection**: Automatic active/standby node detection using validator monitor
- **SSH Connection Pooling**: Persistent connections for ultra-fast operations
- **Universal Support**: Works with Firedancer, Agave, Solana, and Jito validators

## Security

- **No credential storage**: SSH private keys never leave your `~/.ssh/` directory
- **Path-only configuration**: Only file paths and hostnames stored in config files
- **No network exposure**: Tool operates through SSH connections only
- **Local execution**: All operations run locally, no external services

## Why SVS?

Built by [Huisky Labs](https://huisky.xyz/) validator team who needed reliable switching tools for our own operations. After countless manual switches and near-misses, we built what we wished existed.

- **Battle-tested**: Used in production by Huisky Labs validators
- **Community-driven**: We actively use and improve this tool daily
- **Open source**: Transparency and security through open development
