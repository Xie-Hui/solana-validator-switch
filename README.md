<details>
<summary>Alternative installation methods (requires Rust and Cargo)</summary>

#### Clone and Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huiskylabs/solana-validator-switch
cd solana-validator-switch
cargo run --release
```

#### Install with Cargo
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/huiskylabs/solana-validator-switch

# Add to PATH if not already there
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
svs
```
</details>

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
svs           # Opens interactive menu
```

### Command Line Mode
```bash
svs status              # Check validator status
svs switch              # Perform validator switch
svs switch --dry-run    # Preview switch without executing
svs test-alert          # Test Telegram alert configuration
svs --version           # Show version
svs --help              # Show help
```


## Configuration

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.solana-validator-switch
cp config.example.yaml ~/.solana-validator-switch/config.yaml
nano ~/.solana-validator-switch/config.yaml
```

See [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) for the full configuration template.

### Telegram Alerts Setup (Optional)

To enable Telegram notifications:

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**:
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
   - Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
   - Save the bot token (looks like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`)

2. **Get Your Chat ID**:
   - Add the bot to a group or start a private chat with it
   - Send a message to the bot
   - Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Find your chat ID in the response (negative for groups, positive for private chats)

3. **Configure in config.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   alert_config:
     enabled: true
     delinquency_threshold_seconds: 30  # Alert after 30 seconds without voting
     telegram:
       bot_token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
       chat_id: "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
   ```

4. **Test Your Configuration**:
   ```bash
   svs test-alert
   ```

You'll receive notifications for:
- **Validator Delinquency** (CRITICAL): When your validator stops voting for more than 30 seconds
  - Only triggers when SSH and RPC are both working (no false alarms)
  - Includes SSH and RPC connection status in the alert
- **SSH Connection Failures** (LOW PRIORITY): When SSH connections fail repeatedly
  - Triggers after 100 consecutive failures or 30 minutes of failures
  - Very loose thresholds to avoid noise
- **RPC Connection Failures** (LOW PRIORITY): When RPC calls fail due to throttling or network issues
  - Triggers after 100 consecutive failures or 30 minutes of failures
  - Very loose thresholds to avoid noise
- **Catchup Failures**: When standby node fails catchup 3 times in a row
- **Switch Results**: Success/failure notifications with timing details

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Switching**: Get the fastest switch possible with optimized streaming operations
- **Runtime Status Detection**: Automatic active/standby node detection using validator monitor
- **SSH Connection Pooling**: Persistent connections with multiplexing for ultra-fast operations
- **Optimized Tower Transfer**: Streaming base64 decode + dd for minimal latency
- **Universal Support**: Works with Firedancer, Agave, Solana, and Jito validators
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with Ratatui-based terminal UI
- **Telegram Alerts**: Real-time notifications for validator health and switch events
  - Delinquency alerts when validator stops voting
  - Standby node catchup failure monitoring
  - Switch success/failure notifications
- **Enhanced Status Display**: Improved UI with countdown timers and alert status

## Security

- **No credential storage**: SSH private keys never leave your `~/.ssh/` directory
- **Path-only configuration**: Only file paths and hostnames stored in config files
- **No network exposure**: Tool operates through SSH connections only
- **Local execution**: All operations run locally, no external services

## Why SVS?

Built by [Huisky Labs](https://huisky.xyz/) validator team who needed reliable switching tools for our own operations. After countless manual switches and near-misses, we built what we wished existed.

- **Battle-tested**: Used in production by Huisky Labs validators
- **Community-driven**: We actively use and improve this tool daily
- **Open source**: Transparency and security through open development

### Support Development

If SVS saves you time and SOL, consider:
- ‚≠ê Starring this repo to help other validators find it
- üó≥Ô∏è Delegating to [Huisky Labs validators](https://huisky.xyz/) 
- üêõ Reporting issues or contributing improvements

## Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] **Ultra-fast switching** - Sub-second identity switches with optimized streaming operations
- [x] **Universal validator support** - Works with Firedancer, Agave, Solana, and Jito
- [x] **Interactive CLI** - User-friendly menu system with guided workflows  
- [x] **Dry-run mode** - Test switches without executing for safety
- [x] **SSH connection pooling** - Persistent connections with multiplexing for instant commands
- [x] **Auto-detect active/standby** - Runtime detection of validator states
- [x] **Optimized tower transfer** - Streaming base64 decode + dd for minimal latency
- [x] **Interactive dashboard** - Real-time monitoring with Ratatui-based terminal UI
- [x] **Modern async architecture** - Tokio-based async runtime with Arc<Session> efficiency
- [x] **Telegram notifications** - Real-time alerts for validator health and switch events

## Development

### Pre-commit Hooks

To ensure code quality and prevent CI failures, set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
./setup-hooks.sh

# The hook will now run automatically on every commit
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# To bypass the hook in emergencies
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency commit"

# To run checks manually
.githooks/pre-commit
```

The pre-commit hook runs the exact same checks as GitHub Actions CI:
- Code formatting check (`cargo fmt -- --check`)
- Clippy linting (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- Tests (`cargo test --verbose`)
- Build verification (`cargo build --verbose --release`)
- Security audit (`cargo audit`)
