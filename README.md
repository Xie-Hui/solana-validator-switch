## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Auto-detects your platform and installs the latest version
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huiskylabs/solana-validator-switch/main/install.sh | bash

# After installation, 'svs' is available immediately
svs
```

<summary>Alternative installation methods (requires Rust and Cargo)</summary>

#### Clone and Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huiskylabs/solana-validator-switch
cd solana-validator-switch
cargo run --release
```

#### Install with Cargo
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/huiskylabs/solana-validator-switch

# Add to PATH if not already there
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
svs
```
</details>

## Usage

```bash
svs           # Opens interactive menu
svs --version # Show version
```


## Configuration

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.solana-validator-switch
cp config.example.yaml ~/.solana-validator-switch/config.yaml
nano ~/.solana-validator-switch/config.yaml
```

See [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) for the full configuration template.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Switching**: Get the fastest switch possible with optimized operations
- **Runtime Status Detection**: Automatic active/standby node detection using validator monitor
- **SSH Connection Pooling**: Persistent connections for ultra-fast operations
- **Universal Support**: Works with Firedancer, Agave, Solana, and Jito validators

## Security

- **No credential storage**: SSH private keys never leave your `~/.ssh/` directory
- **Path-only configuration**: Only file paths and hostnames stored in config files
- **No network exposure**: Tool operates through SSH connections only
- **Local execution**: All operations run locally, no external services

## Why SVS?

Built by [Huisky Labs](https://huisky.xyz/) validator team who needed reliable switching tools for our own operations. After countless manual switches and near-misses, we built what we wished existed.

- **Battle-tested**: Used in production by Huisky Labs validators
- **Community-driven**: We actively use and improve this tool daily
- **Open source**: Transparency and security through open development

### Support Development

If SVS saves you time and SOL, consider:
- ‚≠ê Starring this repo to help other validators find it
- üó≥Ô∏è Delegating to [Huisky Labs validators](https://huisky.xyz/) 
- üêõ Reporting issues or contributing improvements

## Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] **Ultra-fast switching** - Sub-second identity switches with optimized operations
- [x] **Universal validator support** - Works with Firedancer, Agave, Solana, and Jito
- [x] **Interactive CLI** - User-friendly menu system with guided workflows  
- [x] **Dry-run mode** - Test switches without executing for safety
- [x] **SSH connection pooling** - Persistent connections for instant commands
- [x] **Auto-detect active/standby** - Runtime detection of validator states
- [x] **Tower file transfer** - Automated tower synchronization with progress tracking

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] **Continuous monitoring** - Real-time validator health monitoring with configurable alerts
- [ ] **Auto-switch on failure** - Automatic failover when primary validator goes down
- [ ] **Multi-validator support** - Manage multiple validator pairs from one interface
- [ ] **Slack/Discord notifications** - Get alerts when primary node is stopped voting and when switches occur
