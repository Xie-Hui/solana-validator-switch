echo "This test verifies:"
echo "1. Telegram 's' command executes real switch without Y/N prompt"
echo "2. UI doesn't show overlapping views when switches are triggered" 
echo "3. All keyboard shortcuts work as expected"
echo ""
echo "Test Plan:"
echo "-----------"
echo ""
echo "1. Start SVS status UI:"
echo "   ./target/release/svs status"
echo ""
echo "2. Test keyboard shortcuts in the UI:"
echo "   - Press 'v' → Should show validator status view"
echo "   - Press 'd' → Should show dry-run switch view (returns after 10s)"
echo "   - Press 's' → Should NOT work (removed to prevent accidental switches)"
echo ""
echo "3. Test Telegram commands:"
echo "   - Send 'v' → UI should change to validator status view"
echo "   - Send 'sd' → UI should change to dry-run switch view"
echo "   - Send 's' → Should execute REAL switch WITHOUT changing UI view"
echo "                and WITHOUT Y/N prompt (monitor logs for confirmation)"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior for Telegram 's' command:"
echo "- Log shows: '⚠️ PERFORMING REAL VALIDATOR SWITCH...'"
echo "- Switch executes immediately without Y/N prompt"
echo "- UI stays on current view (no overlap/broken UI)"
echo "- Log shows: '✅ Validator switch completed!'"
echo "- Telegram receives switch result message"
